This is a story.

I know stories aren't quite meant to go on GitHub (it's more of a coder's workstation), but I'm not a good programmer. Stories, though?  Stories I can do.
In fact, GitHub is different in that it allows multiple people to contribute; anyone they want, if they wish, can add something to the code in question.
I find it strange that writing has no equivalent option. Writing, in general, seems to be stereotyped as completely different; it's usually considered a task to do alone, something you do in your faraway wooden cabin.
I find that solitary spirit discouraging, and the collaborative and free-natured spirit of coding encouraging.
So why not try combining writing with the collaborative spirit of GitHub?

This is a story.  But there is nothing here... yet. I will write here sometimes, but I will also leave it to the world to add to this story. Maybe together, we can make something unique and clever, that exceeds the sum of its parts.
Sure, stories aren't coding, but with the right documentation, organization, and experimental spirit, we don't need to code this one. Maybe we can just write it.
