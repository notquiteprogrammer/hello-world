# hello-world
this is a hello-world repository.

In the future, this page will contain plot outlines, character sheets, resources, and other methods of communication.
It will also contain a guide to the story so far.

But that's all for the future.
For now, it's just a blank readme.
Stare at it, and rejoice. (Or, you know, get writing!)
